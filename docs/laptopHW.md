**Required: laptop capable of running Ubuntu 24.04 Linux VM within VMware**

This has only been tested with x86 and ARM-based Macs, but in principle it should work regardless of the host OS, as you only need to pass the USB devices through to the Ubuntu VMware VMs.

**Required: custom packet sending hardware (for Braktooth/Sweyntooth/Sniffle)**

For Braktooth - [ESP-WROVER-KIT](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP-WROVER-KIT-VE?qs=KUoIvG%2F9Ilbci6DcltJYaA%3D%3D&mgh=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1OOewJvugQMVik9HAR0FxgvkEAQYASABEgJ01PD_BwE) - ~\$40/unit

For Sweyntooth - [nRF52840 USB dongle](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Nordic-Semiconductor/nRF52840-Dongle?qs=gTYE2QTfZfTbdrOaMHWEZg%3D%3D) - ~\$10/unit

For Sniffle - 2x [Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus-P](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-p/) - ~\$20/unit (**NOTE: Don’t buy the “Dongle-E” variants!** It must say “Dongle-P”.)

**Required: accessories**

* 1x - [Separate-power-optional USB-A hub](https://amzn.to/3VILnnj) - ~$17/unit
* * Necessary because there's not enough USB ports for everything you need to connect

---
**Nice to have: general**

* 1x - [USB-A GPS receiver](https://amzn.to/44srqCJ) - ~$19/unit
* * Not necessary if you're only going to place sniffers at a single known location. Necessary if you're going to wander around and want to know where something was observed.

TODO: make a new pic w/ USB dongles etc
