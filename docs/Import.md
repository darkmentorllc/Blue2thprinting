# Import data into MySQL

**Note:** Because data parsing and database lookups can be CPU/IO intensive, it is generally recommended to *not* perform data import or analysis on the capture device (the UP^2 in this case.) Rather, it is recommended to copy all data off to a separate, faster, analysis system, and perform the subsequent steps there.

## One time setup

**Linux Software Setup**: You should already have the necessary MySQL (MariaDB) database and tshark tools installed from the above apt-get commands.

```
cd ~/Blue2thprinting
sudo ./setup_analysis_helper_ubuntu2404.sh
```

**macOS Software Setup**: macOS cannot be used for collection, but it can be used for analysis of files collected on other platforms. You must first [install HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), and then run `brew install mysql`. Then also edit `/usr/local/etc/my.cnf` and add `secure_file_priv = /tmp` at the end of the file, and then start the mysql server with `/usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql`.

Then run

```
cd ~/Blue2thprinting
sudo ./setup_analysis_helper_macOS.sh
```

The above `setup_analysis_helper*.sh` scripts should be re-run if you ever do a "git pull" in the `Blue2thprinting/public` directory, which contains the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers information, to get updated assigned vendor UUID16s.

## Importing data from btmon .bin HCI log files and Sniffle .pcap files

**Import ExampleData:**

```
cd ~/Blue2thprinting/Analysis
./Import_All_HCI_and_PCAP.py --HCI-logs-folder ../ExampleData/ --pcaps-folder ../ExampleData/
```

**To confirm that some data was successfully imported, you can issue:**

```
mysql -u user -pa -D bt2 -e "SELECT * FROM LE_bdaddr_to_name LIMIT 10;"
```

This should show some of the same sort of device name data that you could see by the above `./dump_names_specific.sh` command.

**Import your own data:**

Eventually once you have many files from your own collection that you want to process in bulk, you will run the below command:

```
cd ~/Blue2thprinting/Analysis
./Import_All_HCI_and_PCAP.py --HCI-logs-folder ../Logs/btmon/ --pcaps-folder ../Logs/sniffle/
```


## Importing BTC LMP data from BTC_2THPRINT.log

Both `central_all_launcher2.py` and my `LMP2thprint.cpp` Braktooth module log information about attempted and successful LL2thprint to the file `/home/user/Blue2thprinting/Logs/BTC_2THPRINT.log` (or alt user home directory if you reconfigured it). To import this data into the database, (copy the data from your capture system to your analysis system, if applicable, and then) run the following:

```

cd ~/Blue2thprinting/Analysis/
python3 ./parse_BTC_2THPRINT_2db.py
```

Unfortunately no deduplication of data is possible currently due to the fact that I don't know how to obtain the BDADDR from within Braktooth and add it to every log line. If you know how, LMK! Because currently this is dependent on `central_all_launcher2.py` prepending log entries to let the parsing know what BDADDR the subsequent data is for.

**To confirm that some data was successfully imported, you can issue:**

```
mysql -u user -pa -D bt -e "SELECT * FROM LMP_VERSION_RES LIMIT 10;"
```
