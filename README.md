# OST2 Class Now Available!

The class ["Bluetooth 2222: Bluetooth reconnaissance with Blue2thprinting"](https://ost2.fyi/BT2222) is now available on [OpenSecurityTraining2](https://ost2.fyi/)!

This class takes on average about 8.5h to complete, and is by far the best way to learn how to use this software. It provides you with a preconfigured VM and walks you through the 30+ Bluetooth data types which are exposed for your analysis. Afterwards you can come back and load Blue2thprinting on to whichever of the physical setups below works best for you.
