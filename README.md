# OST2 Class Now Available!

The class ["Bluetooth 2222: Bluetooth reconnaissance with Blue2thprinting"](https://ost2.fyi/BT2222) is now available on [OpenSecurityTraining2](https://ost2.fyi/) as part of the new [Bluetooth Learning Path](https://ost2.fyi/OST2_LP_Bluetooth.pdf)!

This class takes on average about 8.5h to complete, and is by far the best way to learn how to use this software. It provides you with a preconfigured VM and walks you through the 30+ Bluetooth data types which are exposed for your analysis. Afterwards you can come back and load Blue2thprinting on to whichever of the physical setups below works best for you.


# üí•Breaking changesüí•

If you have data from running Blue2thprinting before tag `2.2.0`, you will need to execute the following commands to migrate the table names after tag `2.2.0` (commit `ac416c8c2f78a93038be15ecdec6a62913d97ad9`):

```
echo "rename tables"
mysql -u user -pa --database='bt2' --execute="RENAME TABLE bttest.LMP_NAME_RES TO bttest.LMP_NAME_RES_defragmented;"
mysql -u user -pa --database='bttest' --execute="RENAME TABLE bttest.LMP_NAME_RES TO bttest.LMP_NAME_RES_defragmented;"

echo "create new tables"
cd ~/Blue2thprinting/Analysis/one_time_initialization
./initialize_database.sh
./initialize_test_database.sh
```


# Hardware Setup Guides

You should pick one of the below targets which best matches your goals.

| Image | Setup instructions  | 
|-----|-------------|
| ![](./docs/img/laptop.jpg) | [Any random x86-based laptop](./docs/laptopHW.md) <p> Best for convenience. |
| ![](./docs/img/tiny2th.jpg) | [tiny2th](./docs/minHW.md) <p> Best for small size. |
| ![](./docs/img/Blue2th_IAB9.jpeg) | [Blue2thprinting Pro Max Extreme Edition!](./docs/maxHW.md) <p> Best for capabilities. |
